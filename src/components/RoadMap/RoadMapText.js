          continue creating value for the community, not for personal benefits
          but for everyone who believes that an NFT is just more than a PNG file
          on the cloud. We have designed our milestones to match our minting
          process, that way we know there’s a community behind us. Once we
          finish our minting process we will let our community to propose and
          vote! Everyone counts.
